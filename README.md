Machine Learning Demonstration
John Ryan Kivela The Narbha INstitute January 2025

Things to know:
All of these materials will be located in a public Github repository which makes them open source. I control changes, but anyone can access them. If Github requires a log in, you should be able to use your Google account login.

The intended audience is a discerning group of professionals with strong data literacy, and advanced education in basic math like Central Limits Theorum (Mean, Median, Mode, Standard Deviation, etc.), and basic Linear Algebra. Calculus is not required.

The goal is for the instructor to walk through the Notebook with the audience watching and discussing. The instructor and the class go through the notebook together.

It is not necessary to understand the code languages. The notebook will run all calculations out-of-the-box.
